## Steps taken React App
1. get the thing to render on the screen
1. figure out the data you need to render it
1. set up the **state**
1. Make render use app's state (replacing the hardcoded data from render)
1. handle events from interactive elements (`onClick`, `onChange`)
1. Connect those to methods that update the app's state (`this.setState`)
